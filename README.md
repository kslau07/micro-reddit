## Project description

This is the 2nd Rails project in Odin. The purpose of this project is to help us be more familiar with the M in MVC architecture. We will apply basic knowledge of Active Record to our app, we will work with migrations, validations, and associations.

***

## My goals

- I want to understand how migrations work.

- I will apply some of the validation techniques we read about.  

- I hope to better understand these model associations we've learned recently:

	- `belongs_to`
	- `has_one`
	- `has_many`
	- `has_many :through`
	- `has_one :through`
	- `has_and_belongs_to_many`
